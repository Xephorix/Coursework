# Ethan Cook - Cybersecurity Course (2021-Unspecified)

This is a collection of the work (Or at least most of it) I have completed during my time in the Cybersecurity course. I have a few breif descriptions of each course and what I learned in them below, if you're interested.

## ITECH 3010 Fundamentals
This course lasted from 8 September 2021 to 26 September 2021

I learned basic web development and information tech concepts such as how to identify parts of a computer, and how to take a computer apart safely and effectively. This course was a great refresher of my knowledge in these subjects, and was a great way to solidify the concepts and information I already knew.

## ITECH 3000 Math
This course lasted from 26 September 2021 to 10 November 2021

Honestly the name is pretty self-explanitory. I learned more concepts in binary and hex math. I did actually learn some new things though. I learned how to do simple math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to binary and hexadecimal numbers of any length.

## ITECH 1022 Web Development
This course lasted from 10 November 2021 to 17 December 2021

This course was by far the hardest. I learned a lot of new concepts and further got used to and implemented concepts that I already had a basic knowledge of. I created a website from the ground up with the help from a textbook and then did the same process but completely on my own. I actually had to ask for help a few times in this course, something that I never had need of in earlier courses. Despite this, I feel as though this class has taught me the most up to this point.
