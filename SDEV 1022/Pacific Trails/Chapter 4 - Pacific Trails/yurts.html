                <strong>What is a yurt?</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully
                enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
            </dd>

                <strong>How are yurts furnished?</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
                Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
                running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                <strong>What should I bring?</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with
                light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
