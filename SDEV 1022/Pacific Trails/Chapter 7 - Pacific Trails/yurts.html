                    <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off
                        the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas
                        walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be
                        opened.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>How are yurts furnished?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down
                        quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping
                        experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and
                        cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are
                        located in the lodge.

                    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to
                        dress for changing weather with light layers of
                        clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a
                        sense of adventure!
                    </p>
